## About me

In May 2021, I graduated from _Makerere University, College of Business and Management Sciences with a degree in Development Economics_. I also hold a diploma in Civil Engineering from the _Uganda Technical College Bushenyi_. I am particularly passionate about examining effective and evidence-based education policy in Uganda and Africa more broadly.

I am the co-founder of _The Economic Misfit_(https://theeconomicmisfit.com/), a startup company focused on powering African knowledge, and the _Move NETwork International_ with a mission to equip and empower young people with life planning and development skills to pace with the competitive world for transformation.
