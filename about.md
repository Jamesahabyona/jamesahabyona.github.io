## About me

I am a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow at [Yaleâ€™s Tobin Center for Economic Policy](https://tobin.yale.edu/), where I work with professors [Christopher Neilson](https://christopherneilson.github.io/) (Princeton) and [John Eric Humphries](http://johnerichumphries.com/) on topics related to school choice and the market for childcare services in CT. Prior to joining the Tobin Center, I worked at [IPA](http://www.poverty-action.org/study/information-about-returns-post-primary-education-peru) in Peru, and at [J-PAL LAC](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/latin-america-caribbean) in the Dominican Republic, studying basic and higher education markets in the context of developing economies. I received my B.A. in Economics from the _Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru_ in 2018.
