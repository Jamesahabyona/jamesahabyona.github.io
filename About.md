## About me
I am a Ugandan born and raised in Kampala, and i am interested in Development Economics research particularly education inequality and exploring ways to improve access to quality education , regardless of background or location.
 
I am a final year Master's in Economics student at [Nova School of Business and Economics](https://www.novasbe.unl.pt/en/programs/masters/economics/program). where I have taken advanced classes in microeconometrics, machine learning, and development economics, and am passionate about leveraging data-driven approaches to solve complex real-world problems. 

In my previous experience, I've led teams at a startup and a non-profit, honing my leadership and project management skills. Additionally, as a research assistant, I have developed expertise in web scraping, literature reviews, and data management. I have a proven track record of communicating complex data analysis findings to technical and non-technical audiences, through presentations, reports, and papers. For instance, I recently co-authored a report titled ["Child labour in Uganda: An annotated Bibliography"](jamesahabyona.github.io/Uganda-1.pdf) with Vanessa Cordeiro, which highlights the latest research on this pressing issue.
