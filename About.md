## About me
I am interested in Development Economics research. In my master's thesis, I study technology adoption and adaptation to climate change in Mozambique I am a final year Master's in Economics student at [Nova School of Business and Economics](https://www.novasbe.unl.pt/en/programs/masters/economics/program). 
I co-founded  [Move Network International(MNI)](https://www.moveinternational.org/) , a youth-led Organization that operates in my community of  Luzira, a suburb of Kampala, Uganda. As part of MNI, recently secured a $1500 grant to launch a financial empowerment program benefiting over 35 teenage mothers in our community.

I am a development economist with a keen interest in technology adoption, school choice, and teacher labor markets. In my master's thesis, I combine tools from behavioral economics and mobile money transaction data to test a novel method for measuring mobile money adoption.
