As a final year Master's in Economics student at Nova School of Business and Economics, I have taken advanced classes in microeconometrics, machine learning, international migration and development economics, and am passionate about leveraging data-driven approaches to solve complex real-world problems. With a strong foundation in data analysis, I am proficient in Stata and R, and have extensive experience working with Python packages such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, and Scikit-learn. These packages have been invaluable in efficiently performing data cleaning, manipulation, visualization, and modeling tasks in my individual and group projects.

I am continuously expanding my skillset and currently taking a Machine Learning class where I am applying various algorithms, including Linear and Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, and K-Means Clustering. I am also skilled in ensemble methods such as Boosting and Bagging, and have experience using regularization and cross-validation techniques to improve model performance. In addition, I have experience with Latent Dirichlet Allocations and Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction to gain insights into complex data sets and make data-driven recommendations.

In my previous experience, I've led teams at a startup and a non-profit, honing my leadership and project management skills. Additionally, as a research assistant, I have developed expertise in web scraping, literature reviews, and data management. I have a proven track record of communicating complex data analysis findings to technical and non-technical audiences, through presentations, reports, and papers. For instance, I recently co-authored a report titled ["Child labour in Uganda: An annotated Bibliography".](jamesahabyona.github.io/Uganda-1.pdf) with Vanessa Cordeiro, which highlights the latest research on this pressing issue.
