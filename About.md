## About me
I am interested in Development Economics research particularly education inequality and exploring ways to improve access to quality education , regardless of background or location. I am a final year Master's in Economics student at [Nova School of Business and Economics](https://www.novasbe.unl.pt/en/programs/masters/economics/program) 

I recently co-authored a report titled ["Child labour in Uganda: An annotated Bibliography"](Uganda-1.pdf) with Vanessa Cordeiro, which highlights the latest research on this pressing issue.

You can find my CV [here]().

### Fields of interest
