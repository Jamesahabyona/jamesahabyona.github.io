## About me
I am a Development Economist with a keen interest in technology adoption, school choice, and teacher labor markets. 

I co-founded  [Move Network International (MNI)](https://www.moveinternational.org/) , a youth-led Organization that operates in my community of  Luzira, a suburb of Kampala, Uganda. As part of MNI, I recently secured a $1500 grant to launch a financial empowerment program benefiting over 35 teenage mothers in our community. This project is highlighted in   [The 2024 Little Big Fund Impact report](https://www.littlebig.fund/s/LBF-Impact-Report-Presentation-1.pdf) showcasing community-led social changemakers around the world.
