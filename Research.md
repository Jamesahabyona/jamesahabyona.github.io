### Working Papers

 "Can Games measure mobile money adoption? Evidence from Mozambique" , _Master’s thesis supervised by:  [Professor Catia Batista](https://www.catiabatista.org/) (Nova SBE). <b>Draft available on request</b>_
 <Details>
<pre> Forecasting the adoption of technological innovations is difficult but potentially impactful, <br> 
 particularly in rural low-income communities worldwide. This paper tests a novel method to measure
 mobile money adoption by employing behavioral measures to elicit preferences for saving or remitting <br>
 using mobile money. I link these game decisions to individual-level mobile money administrative <br>
 transaction data; my findings show that while willingness to remit through mobile money strongly predicts <br> 
 adoption in the second and third years after mobile money was introduced,willingness to save in the mobile <br>
 money game is a strong predictor of future mobile money cash-in and any mobile money transaction in the first,<br> 
 second, and third years.</pre>
