 <Details>
<pre> Forecasting the adoption of technological innovations is difficult but potentially impactful, <br> 
 particularly in rural low-income communities worldwide. This paper tests a novel method to <br> 
  measure mobile money adoption by employing behavioral measures to elicit preferences for saving <br> 
 or remitting using mobile money. I link these game decisions to individual-level mobile money <br>
 administrative transaction data; my findings show that while willingness to remit through mobile <br> 
 money strongly predicts  adoption in the second and third years after mobile money was introduced <br>
 ,willingness to save in the mobile money game is a strong predictor of future mobile money cash-in <br>  
 and any mobile money transaction in the first,second, and third years.</pre>
